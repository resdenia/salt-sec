# Salt

In this project, I have developed a dynamic table interface that meticulously organizes user data, facilitating an efficient and intuitive search and filtering capability. This feature allows for seamless navigation and manipulation of user information, significantly enhancing user interaction and data accessibility. Through this implementation, users can effortlessly locate and sort data based on specific criteria, streamlining the overall user experience and improving data management efficiency.

## Technology

To build that application I used that tech stack:

- React
- Typescript
- styled-components
- Redux
- Redux Toolkit
- Vite
- Jest
- Eslint

### Methodology

For structure of the frontend part was choosen Atomic pattern of development.
Component>Section>Container>Page
It emphasizes building UIs in a systematic way by breaking down interfaces into fundamental building blocks and then combining them to form larger, reusable components. The goal is to create a design system that is both scalable and maintainable.

## Run Project
